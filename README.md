# CVE-2021-44228-ScannersListFromRF

In light with a huge amount of IPs being linked to Log4Shell scanners, for its customers, RF created a two threat lists that were released in the platform and accessible to Threat Intell analysts:

- List 1: Log4Shell Potentially Malicious Scanners (this list contains IPs that have been observed scanning for CVE-2021-44228 with potential malicious activity. It includes scanners that have been observed attempting to directly load payloads and repetitively send exploit payloads without providing indications of who is conducting the activity. Follow on payloads from these IPs have included coin miners, backdoors, and IOT botnets)
- List 2: Log4Shell-Related Scanners (this list includes all servers that were observed probing for log4j instances to identify vulnerable systems. This includes legitimate security vendors attempting to identify vulnerable systems as well as malicious activity)

For a flexibility, instead of manually downloading them from the portal, this Python script can be used to pull a fresh/updated threat lists via the [list API](https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058691913-List-API) and token (available for customers):

```
python3 log4ScanIP.py --token "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Once run, then it will prompt to choose from either of the two lists:

**all** - Log4Shell related scanners

**mal** - Log4Shell potentially malicious scanners

It will then download it in CSV format
